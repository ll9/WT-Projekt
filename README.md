# Title tbd

Simple Website to add your favorite movies and add them to your watchlist etc. The website is powered by data from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=de). The data is stored in a mongo DB. [This tool](https://github.com/ll9/tmdb2mongo/tree/master) was used to fetch the movie data from the [TMDB-API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=de) and store it into mongo.
You can check out the heroku demo webpage [here](https://radiant-tor-61008.herokuapp.com/)

### Setup
In order to run this Website locally you will ned node + mongodb which contains the appropriate data. Furthermore in your mongodb you will have to create an text index on the title attribute (see below).
1. start your mongo database (`mongod --dbpath <path_to_database`)
2. If your db has no text index yet: In your mongo shell: 
    ```
    use <dbName>
    db.<collectionName>.createIndex({ title: "text"})
    ```
3. Install modules (only once): `npm install`
4. Start the server: `npm start`
5. Check out the website in your browser at http://localhost:3000/

#### To-do
- [ ] Implement Login (Hofmann) !
- [ ] __Design Watchlist__ (Hofmann) !
- [ ] Implement Adding to watchlist (Hofmann) !
- [ ] Implement Personal Rating (Hofmann)
- [ ] create database which stores user information (watching, rating etc.)
- [ ] Fix Movie Description (Some Descriptions are too long and overflow) (Bacher) !
- [ ] Implement search by person (might be difficult)
- [ ] Find better template picture 
- [ ] When you visit the home page it takes movies aren't displayed immediately => either cache movies to load immediately (?) or implement loading animation !
- [ ] Move Watchlist to seperate Page !
- [ ] Add Animation when you are searching for a movie (might be possible with endless scrolling Animation)
- [ ] Provide a Database with ~ 50.000 movies which also can handle user information (Wierer) !
- [ ] Fix Endless Scrolling Bug (Scrolling Animation even though there is nothing more to scroll) 
- [ ] *Make Website prettier* (Hofmann, later) !
- [ ] Optional: In the future it might be a good idea to refactore the project (multiple vue files etc, put movies class in extra file etc.)
- [ ] Append to-do list (still missing a lot)
---
- [x] Remove 'no more data' text, when endless scrolling is finished/ still loading (Wierer)
- [x] Implement dynamic loading (endless scrolling?) (Wierer) !
- [x] Think of a name for the Website (Hofmann)

- [x] Integrate two sliders into year slider (f.e. select 'from 1980 to 1990' with two sliders) (Bacher)
- [x] Load some movies when you visit the page for the first time (most popular?) (Wierer)
- [x] Implement Mulit-Genre-Selection
- [x] Implement filters (Rating, Year, Genre) (Wierer)
- [x] Fix Sci-Fi Genre filter (doesn't filter correctly because 'Sci-Fi' is not the same as 'Science Fiction' (or was it the other way around?)) (Wierer)
- [x] Add year next to title (Wierer)
- [x] Let Home Button Return to homepage (Wierer)
- [x] Fix Error when there is no picture (template picture?) (Wierer)
