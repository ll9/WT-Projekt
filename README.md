# Title tbd

Simple Website to add your favorite movies and add them to your watchlist etc. The website is powered by data from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=de). The data is stored in a mongo DB. [This tool](https://github.com/ll9/tmdb2mongo/tree/master) was used to fetch the movie data from the [TMDB-API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=de) and store it into mongo.
You can check out the heroku demo webpage [here](https://radiant-tor-61008.herokuapp.com/).

### Setup
In order to run this Website locally you will ned node + mongodb which contains the appropriate data. Furthermore in your mongodb you will have to create an text index on the title attribute (see below).

1. Install modules (only once): `npm install`
2. Setup Environment Variables (only once per session, (databaseURI, client secret, etc)
3. Start the server: `npm start`
4. Check out the website in your browser at http://localhost:3000/

#### To-do

- [ ] Improve Notification Design (Larger, better Contrast, etc.)
- [ ] Add prettier font to Website
