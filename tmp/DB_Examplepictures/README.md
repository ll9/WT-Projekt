Here are some sample pictures of a SQLite Database which might be interesting for the project. The Databse (10.7GB) was created with IMDbPY and datasets from IMDB.
- Datasets: ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/temporaryaccess/
- IMDbPY instructions: https://imdbpy.sourceforge.io/docs/README.sqldb.txt

The table **'title'** is especially interesting. It contains the titles of the movies, tv series, episodes etc. Unfortunately it also contains a lot entries which don't appear to make a lot of sense (like "(#1.2)").
